  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p> As an incoming freshmen the only path I knew was the ones my parents dream for me.
     As a first generation college student I had to forge my own path in a major that I never fully felt settled on. 
     In between Science courses and research I always loved creating things on the internet.
     Now coming to my final year of college I had the random desire to teach myself how to code & within weeks I stumbled upon the Thinkful program as luck would have it.
    I am excited to see where this new road will lead and hoping to be able to put my new skills to the test with a team of other eager web developers. </p>
